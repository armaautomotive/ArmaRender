Test environment: M1 mac
JVM: https://bell-sw.com/pages/downloads/native-image-kit/#nik-23-(jdk-21)
Note: should work the same on windows and linux.
Note: the native oracle based graalvm wont work on my mac.

Build jar: ./build.sh
Run jar: ./run.sh
Build native: ./native_image.sh
Run native: ./ArmaRender_Native


Note: GraalVM can't handle reflection so there is a tool to configure certain functions by running java with the -agentlib attribute. 
You don't need to run the command, this is just an fyi.


Objective 1) Get the Tool icons working. There are many errors but the first one I want to resolve are the tool bar buttons. 
Images do load in the Help menu Splash screen. 

I think the relevent code is in ui.ThemeManager.java, DefaultToolButton.java, buoy.xml.IconResource.java.
